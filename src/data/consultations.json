    "question": "I have an important presentation next week. What would be the best outfit to convey confidence and professionalism?",
    "answer": "For a confident presentation look, I recommend a well-tailored navy blazer with matching trousers, a crisp white button-down shirt, and classic leather oxfords. Navy conveys trust and authority, while the classic combination ensures you look polished and prepared. Add a subtle watch or simple jewelry to complete the look.",

    "question": "I'm attending a wedding next month. The dress code is 'smart casual' - what does that mean exactly?",
    "answer": "Smart casual for a wedding means dressed up but not formal. Think chinos or dress pants with a button-down shirt or polo, a blazer (optional), and leather loafers or clean sneakers. Avoid jeans, shorts, or overly formal suits. Colors should be celebratory but not too bright - navy, beige, or soft pastels work well.",
